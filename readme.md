# PGN Standard

This repository contains the PGN (Portable Game Notation) standard in markdown format. The PGN standard is a standard for the representation of chess games using ASCII text. It is widely used in chess software.

PGN standard includes also the definition of the important subformats of PGN, such as EPD (Extended Position Description) and FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation).

The PGN standard is defined in the file [pgn-standard.md](pgn-standard.md). The Russian translation of the standard is available also - [pgn-standard-ru.md](pgn-standard.ru.md).
